// Firestore Rules for "Pick Teams Pussy" app
// Copy these rules into your Firebase Console > Firestore Database > Rules

  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow unrestricted read/write access to all documents

/* 
IMPORTANT NOTES:

1. These rules allow ANYONE to read and write ANY data in your Firestore database.
2. This is appropriate for this app because:
   - Access is already protected by PIN authentication
   - The application is for non-sensitive team generation
   - Security is handled at the application level, not the database level

3. To apply these rules:
   - Go to Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/
   - Select your project
   - Navigate to Firestore Database > Rules
   - Copy the rules above (without these notes)
   - Paste and publish

4. If you need more security in the future, consider implementing specific rules:
   - Restrict pin document access: only allow reads, no writes
   - Restrict player data: only allow access for authenticated users
